            <li>Ver 0.0.4 || 9/9/2021, 11:58PM EST: Fixed the fact I messed up my entire github page with a file name.</li>
            <li>Ver 0.0.5 || 9/16/2021, 7:30PM EST: Added index.html and indexstyle.css to replace original donomess.github.io link. Coded this in HTML and CSS. Just the shell of what I want the end product of my homepage to be, but just threw this together.</li>
